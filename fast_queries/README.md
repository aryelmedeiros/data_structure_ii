The ongoing climate crisis is one of the biggest problems facing modern-day humanity. In the Internet age, monitoring discourse is critical - especially for such a pressing topic. Harmful disinformation can be identified, and good-faith activism can be empowered using media intelligence. 

The goal of this project is to create few classes that represent the comments about the climate changes on reddit. Three main functions will be implemented and performance evaluated/compared:
>1) given an id of a message on Reddit , return all information about the message;
 
>2) given a lower and upper bound of the "sentiment" column, return all messages with sentiment values between the lower and upper bounds;

>3) given a parameter value, return two messages whose sum of the "score" column value is equal to the parameter. Return -1 if it doesn't exist.
